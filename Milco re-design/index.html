          Board” under the purview of the Ministry of Agriculture. It
          commenced operations with a single Factory in Colombo commissioned
          under the Colombo Plan. Today it boasts of a wide network of milk
          collection, production and sales centers administrated through out
          the island and continue to contribute towards the enhancement of the
          rural economy while providing the much needed nutrition to the
          entire nation. In 1986, the “National Milk Board” was converted into
          “Milk Industries of Lanka Company Limited” as a government owned
          company. After that in 1998 “Kiriya Milk Industries of Lanka (Pvt)
          Ltd.” took over the administration of “Milk Industries of Lanka
          Company Limited”. Later in 2000, “Kiriya” was taken back by the
          government and in 2001 it was named as “Milco (Pvt) Ltd.”, which now
          stands as a 100 % government owned company.
